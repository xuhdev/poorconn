Poorconn is a Python package that simulates poor network conditions. To have an overall feel about poorconn usage, it is
recommended to read :ref:`quickstart` first if you have not done so.

Poorconn consists of two parts:

- The main package :mod:`poorconn` that provides generically useful functions that can be used in any Python code, and
- the subpackage :mod:`poorconn.pytest_plugin` that provides useful `pytest`_ utilities.
